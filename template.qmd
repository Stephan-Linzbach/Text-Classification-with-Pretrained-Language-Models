# Learning Objectives

This tutorial has the following learning objectives:

    Learning how to work with large language models (RoBERTa)
    Customizing (fine-tuning) a large language model for a text classification task in any language (100+ languages supported)
    Low-resource learning (with only a few hundred examples) using the SAM optimizer
    Teaching the different classification targets like multi-label classification and multi-output classification

# Target audience


    Social scientists are willing to learn about using large language models with a basic prior understanding of it
    Social scientists with expertise in large-language models, that are interested in fine-tuning for multiple languages from only a few examples.
    Computer scientists are interested in learning about how large-language models are used for social text classification.
    Advanced NLP researchers and professors looking for tutorials that can help their students in learning new topics.

# Duration

Around 60 minutes

# Social Science Usecase(s)

## Stance Detection on Newspaper Articles

Use Case:
	Imagine you want to understand the different arguments to defend a negative stance towards a specific political party.
Method Application:
	Create a training dataset that contains news articles that are 'Against', 'In Favor', or 'Unconnected' to the political party in question.
	You can now use the tutorial to learn how to train a model to learn the labels you have decided.
	With this model, you can categorize a big dataset automatically. 
	Now you can analyze only those articles that are marked as 'Against' by the model to understand the arguments used to argue against the specific political party.


## Topic Classification for Social Science Survey Questions

Use Case:
	Imagine you want to group questions by their topic to subsequently group the answers into more conclusive insights than just the independent answers.
Method Application:
	Think about a taxonomy of topics that is interesting to your analysis.
	Create a training dataset that contains a small fraction of the questions that you are interested in.
	Label the questions with the topic you associate with them.
	In the best case, several people perform this same task (Maybe ChatGPT can help you as well).
	Next, you can train the model using the tutorial to predict your topic given the associated question.
	With the fitted model you can now label all questions.
	
## Emotion Detection in Social Media Posts

Use Case:
	Imagine you want to understand the topics and writing styles associated with a specific topic.
Method Application:
	If you have a large dataset of social media posts you can use the smileys as indication of the emotion mentioned in the post.
	Label each of the social media posts with the smiley used in it.
	Train a model to predict the emoji from the text - make sure to remove the emoji from the training data.
	Now you can apply this to all text even those without emojis.
	Choose the emoji that best describes the emotion you are interested in.
	Now you can focus your analysis on the posts that your model associates with the chosen emoji.
